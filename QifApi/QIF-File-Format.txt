Quicken Interchange Format (QIF) files

The Quicken interchange format (QIF) is a specially formatted text 
(ASCII) file that enables Quicken transactions to be moved from one 
Quicken account register into another Quicken account register, or 
to or from other programs that support the QIF format.

Note: For Quicken to translate data from a text file into the 
Quicken register as transactions, the text file must be in the QIF format.

Required File Formatting

Each transaction must end with a symbol, indicating the end of entry.
Each item in the transaction must display on a separate line. 
When Quicken exports an account register or list, it adds a line to 
the top of the file that identifies the type of account or list. 
Listed below are the header lines Quicken adds to the exported files:


Export headers for QIF files
----------------------------
Export headers in QIF files divide separate groups of items such as
accounts or transactions. They can also signify options. Export headers
follow the general format:

!<Header name>:<Export type>

Exportable accounts
-------------------
The table below lists the types of accounts that can be exported and
their export headers:

Export Header	Type of account
!Type:Bank      Bank account
!Type:Cash      Cash account
!Type:CCard     Credit card account
!Type:Invst     Investment account
!Type:Oth A     Asset account
!Type:Oth L     Liability account
!Type:Invoice   Invoice account (business subtype of Oth A)
!Type:Tax       Tax account (business subtype of Oth L)
!Type:Bill      Bill account (business subtype of Oth L)

An account header is followed by transaction records if there are any
within the selected date range.

Exportable lists
----------------
The table below lists the types of lists that can be exported and their
export headers:

Export Header   Type of list
!Type:Class     Class list
!Type:Cat       Category list
!Type:Memorized Memorized transactions list
!Type:Security  Securities list
!Type:Prices    Security Prices list
!Type:Budget    Budgets list
!Type:Invitem   Invoice items list
!Type:Template  Business templates list
!Type:Tag       Tag list

A list header is followed by records of the selected list type.

Option headers
---------------
The table below lists the options that can be exported and their
export headers:

Export Header           Header Meaning
!Option:AutoSwitch      Start of the Accounts list
!Account                Beginning of accounts list records
!Clear:AutoSwitch       End of the Accounts list

!Account is followed by either a list of account records for the
Accounts list or a single account record for the selected account
transactions.

Quicken can be configured to import all transfers, regardless of whether 
Ignore Transfers is selected when the file is imported. To do this, 
add a line to the file being imported into the Quicken account. 
Use a text editor or word processor to put the following line 
immediately after the header line at the top of the file:

!Option:AllXfr

Identifiers for non-investment accounts
---------------------------------------
Use these letters to identify specific items in a non-investment account
transaction. Each line in the transaction must begin with one of these
letters:
Letter  What it means
D       Date
T       Amount of transaction
U       Amount of transaction (higher possible value than T)
C       Cleared status
N       Number (check or reference)
P       Payee/description
M       Memo
A       Address (up to 5 lines; 6th line is an optional message)
L       Category/class or transfer/class

$       Dollar amount of split
%       Percentage of split if percentages are used
F       Reimbursable business expense flag
^       End of entry

Repeat the S, E, % and $ lines as many times as necessary for additional
items in a split. If an item is omitted from the transaction in the QIF
file, Quicken treats it as a blank item.

Identifiers for investment accounts
-----------------------------------
Use these letters to identify specific items in an investment account
transaction. Each line in the transaction must begin with one of these
letters:

Letter  What it means
D       Date (optional)
N       Action
Y       Security
I       Price
Q       Quantity (# of shares or split ratio)
C       Cleared status
P       1st line text for transfers/reminders
M       Memo
O       Commission
L       For MiscIncX or MiscExpX actions:Category/class
        followed by |transfer/class of the transaction
        For MiscInc or MiscExp actions:Category/class of the transaction
        For all other actions:Transfer/class of the transactions
T       Amount of transaction
U       Amount of transaction (higher possible value than T)
$       Amount transferred
^       End of entry

If an item is omitted from the transaction in the QIF file, Quicken
treats it as a blank item.


Identifiers for memorized transaction items
-------------------------------------------
Use these letters to identify specific items in a memorized transaction.
Each line in the transaction must begin with one of these letters or
combination of letters:

Memorized transaction identifiers

The table below lists the identifiers for Memorized Transaction items

3       Number of payments made
4       Payment periods per year

^       End of entry

Repeat the XS, XK, X Ft, X# and X$ lines as many times as necessary for
additional items in a split. If an item is omitted from the transaction

Identifiers for security items
------------------------------
Security identifiers

The table below lists the identifiers for securities and what they mean:

Letter  What it means

G       Security goal (College Fund, High Risk, Income, Low Risk)
^       End of entry

Prices record
The records in a list of security prices do not use any letter
identifiers, and take the following form:

"<symbol>",<price>,"<date>"

where <symbol> is the security's ticker symbol, <price> is the security
price, expressed as a whole number and a fractional part, and <date> is
the date the security had that price.

For example, for shares of Intuit updated 6/30/98, with a price of
$50.00 per share, the price record would be:

"INTU",50,"6/30/98"

Each price is followed by a ^ (end of entry indicator).

record by an export header.
