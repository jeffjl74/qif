# QIF Inspector
A program that loads a QIF file into a QifDocument and displays the QifDocument's properties.

This project is not really meant to show the programmer how to use the QIF library. It may be used to show how the QifDocument is parsing a particular QIF file.

The parsing of the sample QIF shown in the API README.md is shown below:
